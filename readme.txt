WP Cards gives your WordPress website the ability to load "cards" into the homepage and header sections of your site.

== Description ==

WP Cards uses WordPress widgets and full-page width sidebars to add the ability to drag-and-drop widgetized cards to a website’s homepage. A theme developer just needs to add the included “home.php” file in their theme, or add a call to a dynamic sidebar to their existing home file, and their theme’s homepage will automatically support full-page width cards.

A website admin can reconfigure their site’s homepage on-the-fly without any programming skills or the need to depend on a programmer to make the changes. The admin just needs to log into the WordPress admin area, click-through to the Widgets admin page and drag-and-drop cards into the homepage’s card sidebar. Adding new page elements, moving page elements up and down, or removing page elements can happen in just a matter of seconds, and the website’s homepage is automatically updated.

WP Cards also supports adding a “Jumbotron” card area to the “header.php” file, Jumbotron cards can be configured to only show up on certain types of pages on the website. For example, a “Search Jumbotron” card can be configured to show up on just the website’s search and 404 pages. Or a “Registration Jumbotron” can be configured to appear just on the website’s homepage.

WP Cards is a framework for adding the card concept to an existing WordPress theme, and is designed to be full extended by other developers. WP Cards comes with a number of already developed cards and can be easily extended by adding new cards to the WP Cards’ “cards” directory, or by adding a “cards” folder to a theme or child theme’s root directory. WP Cards automatically loads all widgets (which use a pre-defined naming convention) from these “cards” directories into the widgets section of the WordPress admin area.

WP Cards’ default cards were built using Bootstrap 3 and are dependent on the Bootstrap 3 CSS and JavaScript files.

WP Cards automatically adds three sidebar areas to the WordPress widgets admin page, these are named “Card Staging Area”, “Header Jumbotron Cards”, and “Home Page Cards”. The “Card Staging Area” is just a sandbox widget area for building out cards before adding them to a live page. The plugin includes a “page-staging.php” file that can be added to an existing theme for admins to preview their cards on. An admin would just have to create a new private page called “Staging” and the logged in admin would be able to view all cards in the card staging area.

Having cards stored in widget areas generated by the WP Cards plugin enables a website admin to switch out WordPress themes over time, the website’s existing cards will still be available to be used and maintained on a new theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-cards` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Optional: To activate the card staging area: First, copy the `page-staging.php` file form `/wp-cards/sample-files/` and paste it into your current theme directory. Next, create a private page called `Staging` with the page slug of `staging`. Finally, go to the widgets area of your websites WordPress admin, and move the desired cards into the `Card Staging Area` widget area. Go to the staging page to preview your cards.
4. Optional: To use cards on the homepage of your current theme: First, create a backup copy of your theme`s existing `home.php` file. Next, copy the `home.php` file form `/wp-cards/sample-files/` and paste it into your current theme directory. Finally, go to the widgets area of your website WordPress admin, and move the desired cards into the `Home Page Cards` widget area. Go to your homepage to preview your cards.
